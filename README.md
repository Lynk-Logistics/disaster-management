Hack Theme:
To build a functional web application that will help during the times of floods by enabling various stakeholders involved like the victims, volunteers and NGOs.

The idea is to build an extensible and scalable web app that could be used in case of any natural disaster. 

Different portals can be created for each disaster. In this way, the app can be used for any disaster.

Users are categorized as victims and volunteers. Users can raise requests calling out for help - either through filling a form on the app or by SMS or WhatsApp. 

Volunteers can signup on the app indicating their availability and their region. 

Requests raised by the victim will be matched to the nearest volunteer using Geo coordinates/pin code. Heatmap of most affected regions are shown.
