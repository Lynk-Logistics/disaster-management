## LYF-LINE

### Problem Statement:
* Medical emergencies in times of flood is a difficult issue to overcome due to harsh climatic conditions which causes severe roadblocks thereby restricting peopleâ€™s commutation to a shorter radius.
* People cannot travel long distances in search of hospitals or meet with a doctor and get the treatment that they require.

### Idea:
* Our application provides a solution to overcome this problem by connecting the user to nearby doctors. (within 1 km radius).
* If there is no network, the offline feature available in our application allows the user to find addresses and phone numbers of the doctors near them.

* Front End + Open Source Libraries
    * Android Studio, 
    * Google Maps v2 Android API,
