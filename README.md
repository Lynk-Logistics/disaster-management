This Repo is the base repo for the mobile app we have created as team. We have used React native to develop a solution for this hackathon. It's getting a simple, clean and easy to use UI to volunteer as well as to get help.

## Steps to clone and run
1. Clone the repository 
2. Navigate to root of project directory 
3. Run **npm install** (assuming you have already have NodeJS in your system)
4. Run **react-native run-android** to run on android and  **react-native run-ios** for iOS
